# PDS Analysis Display (PAD)
Pad is a commissioning tool designed for SBND's PDS system. It's main purpose is to verify the channel mapping of the PDS components by overlying the light the observe with low level reconstructed tracks. The two types of tracks we use in commissioning are [muon tracks](https://github.com/SBNSoftware/sbndcode/blob/develop/sbndcode/Commissioning/MuonTrackProducer_module.cc)

To-do : 
* Implement truth level information
* Implement CRT tracks
